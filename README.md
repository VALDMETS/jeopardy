# CYBER JEOPARDY

http://cyberjeopardy.surge.sh

This is a Jeopardy style in-browser app game for three players. It uses data from http://jservice.io/ for questions and answers and was built with a React framework, including some jQuery and Backbone.

I used a couple of open-source fonts, and made all of the sound effects myself using Ableton Live 9 and Komplete 9. 

This project is part of my 7th week of front-end engineering coursework at the Iron Yard Austin.
